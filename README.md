## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd split-bills
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables.

```
# Convex
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Google Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

- **Convex**:
  1. Sign up for a [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) account.
  2. Create a new project.
  3. Find your project's credentials in the Convex dashboard settings and add them to the `.env.local` file.

- **Clerk**:
  1. Sign up for a [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account.
  2. Create a new application.
  3. Find your API keys in the Clerk dashboard and add them to the `.env.local` file.
  4. In the Clerk dashboard, navigate to **JWT Templates**, create a new template based on Convex, and make it the primary template.

- **Resend**:
  1. Sign up for a [Resend](https://resend.com/) account.
  2. Create an API key and add it to the `.env.local` file.

### 4. Set Up Convex Backend

Run the following command to deploy your backend schema and functions to Convex. It will also sync your environment variables from the Convex dashboard.

```bash
npx convex dev
```

Keep this process running in a separate terminal.

### 5. Set Up Local AI Model (Ollama)

This project uses a local AI model via Ollama to parse expense commands.

1.  **Download and Install Ollama**: Follow the instructions on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/).
2.  **Pull the Mistral Model**: Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    ollama pull mistral
    ```
3.  **Ensure Ollama is running**: The application expects the Ollama API server to be available at `http://localhost:11434`.

### 6. Run the Development Server

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
